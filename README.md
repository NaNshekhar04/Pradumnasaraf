I advocate for **Open Source** literacy and inclusivity. I am working with several communities to bring more people into the Open Source ecosystem and help them in their first-ever **Open Source contribution**.

Some of the projects - [`DDRSS`](https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf/DDRSS) [`Botchain`](https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf/botchain).
